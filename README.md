# Cheat

A card game where you can cheat and lie your way to victory... just don't get caught!

## The original rules

1. The game should start with each player distributed an equal amount of `N` cards.
2. Players take turns to be a `Dealer` who deals a card each round.
3. A player wins when their hand is empty.
4. Cards must be dealt facing out, and the `Dealer` must announce what the card is.
5. The `Dealer` must announce their card SAME rank or an ADJACENT rank of previous `Dealer`'s card.
6. A `Non-dealer` player each round may `Call Cheat` on the `Dealer`. When that happens, the current round's card will be flipped.
7. If the card is truthfully announce by the `Dealer`, the caller will inherit all the previously dealt cards. And if the `Dealer` lied, they will inherit it instead.
8. Afterward, to continue, one card is selected at random from the faced down card pile as the starter card.

## Unique twist

1. The player can take a pass but they must draw a card and can't call cheat next round.
2. If there are no cards to draw, the player must reveal their previously dealt card.
3. When a player possess 4 of a kind of any rank, they may discard the 4 at any point.
